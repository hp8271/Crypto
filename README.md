Assumptions and Shortcuts
Due to time constraints, the following decisions were made:

Used UserDefaults for watchlist persistence instead of a database solution
Implemented basic error handling without extensive edge case coverage
Added a simple 60-second auto-refresh mechanism
No offline mode - internet connection required
Focused on essential features (listing, search, watchlist) rather than detailed analytics
